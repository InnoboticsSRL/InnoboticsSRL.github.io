Getting Started
===============

This chapter provides the basic information to get started with ROS2 on your ComboFox platform.

Network Connection
-------------------

.. note:: Please read the inspection document to get the definite network configuration of your platform.

By default your ComboFox platform will try to connect to the wireless network aw_wifi_demo .

First power up the WiFi access point included and wait until the network aw_wifi_demo is available. Optionally connect the access point to your company/home network via ethernet to enable internet access on the platform when needed.

Next you may connect your PC to aw_wifi_demo too, the password can be found on the access point's exterior.

The IP-Address of your mobile platform is 192.168.3.78.

SSH shell
-------------------------------
Once the platform has booted and your PC is connected to aw_wifi_demo you can connect to the platform using the Remmina Remote Desktop Client application. An example setup is shown below:

Remmina should already be installed on most Ubuntu distributions. See https://remmina.org/ for more information.
